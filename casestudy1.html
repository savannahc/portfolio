    <!--Problem-->
    <div class="half-box black-background">
      <h3>Problem</h3>
      <p>There are many tools for link saving, but no single leading platform. Why?

        <strong>Core issue: All are link “graveyards”,</strong> like my pocket dashboard below . I don’t know what to read first.</p>

    <!--Solution-->
    <!--for desktop size, width 50% display, inline block-->
    <div class="half-box blue-background">
      <h3>Solution</h3>
      <p>Forget Me Not makes it easy for users to save and remember what’s in their links.

        <strong>Forget Me Not is a tool optimized for reading and remembering links, not just saving them</strong></p>

      <ul>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Clarity </strong>· Forget Me Not is about bringing clarity to link saving and to what you remember from the links you save.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Simplicity </strong>· Forget Me Not is a simple and practical solution that doesn’t rely on complicated features or learning how to use another app.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Intuition </strong>· Forget Me Not is about simple, intuitive actions that help you get more out of the time you spend reading online.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>Brightness</strong>· Forget Me Not helps people remember what they read so they can learn better and feel brighter.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h5>I used these to develop a visual identity for Forget Me Not, beginning with mind maps and moodboards and ending with a full brand guide that included copy tone, color palette, logos, and typefaces.</h5>

      <h5>After more brainstorming, I realized that I could add two buttons to the top menu. By making them clearly different from the navigation bar and pinning the menu to the top of the screen, users could tap “remember” or “archive” at the moment they
        were finished with the link, even if they hadn’t scrolled to the bottom.</h5>

      <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
      <h3><strong>For the future:</strong></h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>I did not fully achieve my goal of making users automatically opt to do the retention sequence. They could do it easily, but only did it <strong>after</strong> I asked them how they’d remember what they just read.</li>
        <br>
        <li>I’d optimize the link view for photos and videos since this is big part of content saved on the web</li>
        <br>
        <li>I’d refine the onboarding and saving sequences</li><br>
      </ul>
      <h3><strong>Lessons</strong></h3>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>You must create and test well-differentiated design solutions. In my usability testing I could have tried many other styles of “read” buttons and <strong>gotten more feedback to make my design more intuitive.</strong></li>
        <br>
        <li>Your testers must match your research results <strong>demographically and psychographically.</strong> In my first round of testing, I had one tester who said they would never use the platform. When I asked why they explained that they just never
          forgot to read links. This didn’t match my survey results or personas, so from then on I made sure to use testers who were like my future link-savers.</li>
