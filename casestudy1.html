      <p>There are many tools for link saving, but no single leading platform. Why?

        <strong>Core issue: All are link “graveyards”,</strong> like the pocket dashboard below . There is no indication of priority, so it's not clear what to read first.</p>

          <br>
          <li><strong>Simplicity </strong>· Forget Me Not is a simple and practical solution that doesn’t rely on complicated features or learning how to use another app.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Intuition </strong>· Forget Me Not is about simple, intuitive actions that help you get more out of the time you spend reading online.</li>
          <br>
          <li><strong>Brightness</strong>· Forget Me Not helps people remember what they read so they can learn better and feel brighter.</li>
        </ul>

            <li>I would experiment with the retention sequence. Different types of reminders, like an additional question a few days after reading the link, could help users master new topics and skills.</li>
            <li>I’d optimize the link view for photos and videos since this is big part of content saved on the web</li>

            <li>You must create and test well-differentiated design solutions. In my usability testing I could have tried other ways to start the read sequence, instead of just testing two similar buttons. </li>
            <li>Your testers must match your research results <strong>demographically and psychographically.</strong> In my first round of testing, I had one tester who said they wouldn't find the platform useful. When I asked why they explained that they
              just never forgot to read links. This didn’t match my survey results or personas, so from then on I made sure to use testers who were like my future link-savers.</li>
