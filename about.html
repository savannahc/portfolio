    <h3>When I first saw the Lady and the Tramp at age 8, I decided I would grow up and make a dog shelter that held all the strays in the world. Though I haven’t yet found a way to house millions of dogs, I haven’t stopped wanting to make the world better.

    <p>This desire to create change led me to attend a talk by Muhammad Yunus my junior year of high school. The creator of the first microfinance bank, he described the ripple effect of microloans and how the bank grew without being reliant on donations.
      As I listened, I knew I had found the sort of work I wanted to do. I was inspired by his work to study entrepreneurship at college so that I could use it for social impact. While attending Babson College, <strong>I got funding to test a business idea for a tutoring service.</strong>      My goal was to make it easier for college students to help each other do better, and I was buzzing with excitement as I came up with the idea, made the pitch deck, and launched the website. Unfortunately, the main advantage of my idea — using low-cost
      tutoring provided by other college students — proved to be its downfall. Though I’d recruited a core group of excited tutors, the times when they were needed most (midterms and finals) were also the times when they had the least availability. <strong>RIP Zedu: Tutors on Demand.</strong></p>
    <br> <br><h3>The failure hurt, but it also showed me that great startup ideas had more to do with well-applied design thinking than pure business skills. </h3>
    <br> <br><p>If I had looked more closely into the needs of my tutors, I would have seen that they needed extra time off during midterms and finals. I was sad to see Zedu go, but the joy I’d felt while building it stayed with me. In my next role as a marketer
      (just after I graduated from Babson), <strong>I stayed hungry for the chance to  build something</strong> I used my business and graphic design skills to build a side business doing freelance work. And around the same time, a developer at my company
      asked me for some design advice on the app we were building. He introduced me to the role of a Product Designer and instantly, <strong>I knew I’d found my place. </strong></p>
    <br> <br><h3>Getting inside the heads (and hearts) of users to create beneficial products was the perfect combination of my skills. Plus it was so much fun that I lost track of time while doing it.</h3>
    <br> <br><p>Now I hope to use the power of design to make opportunity more accessible to women and other underserved groups. I’m especially focused on the fields of healthcare and financial technology since they have tremendous potential for improving women's’
      lives. And though I love beautifully scaled type and charming interactions, in my work I focus on the how & why behind design decisions so that I can build truly beneficial products that create a fairer world. </p>
